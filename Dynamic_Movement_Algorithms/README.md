# Dynamic Movement Behaviors
This project was adapted from pseudocode provided in Artificial Intelligence for Games by Ian Millington. My goal was to learn about how to implement the dynamic movement behaviors Seek, Flee, and Arrive, as well as how to plot the movement trajectories. Below is an image of my final plot.
